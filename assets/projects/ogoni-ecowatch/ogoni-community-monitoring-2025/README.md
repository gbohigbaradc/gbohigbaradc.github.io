# Ogoni EcoWatch

Ogoni EcoWatch is a community-driven initiative that combines AI, remote sensing, and structured citizen reporting to improve environmental monitoring and response in Ogoni Land and other impacted regions in Africa. The project focuses on practical, low-cost, and scalable approaches for detecting pollution incidents, documenting evidence, and supporting advocacy and remediation.

This README was added as part of a repository update to document the project folder and next steps.

## Contents of this directory
- `ogoni-ecowatch-project.pdf` — Main project document / report (expected path). Place the PDF here to make it downloadable from the portfolio site.
- `ogoni-ecowatch-thumb.jpg` — Thumbnail image shown on the portfolio project card.
- (Optional) `data/` — Add data samples or anonymised datasets here.
- (Optional) `images/` — Additional images and media for the project.
- (Optional) `code/` — Scripts, notebooks, and reproducible analysis code.

## How the portfolio uses this folder
- The main site (index.html) references `assets/projects/ogoni-ecowatch/ogoni-ecowatch-project.pdf` for the download link shown in the Featured Project card.
- The thumbnail `ogoni-ecowatch-thumb.jpg` is used as the project image in the gallery.

## What I changed / added
- Added this README.md to document the Ogoni EcoWatch folder and guide contributors on how to add the project PDF and supplementary assets.
- Confirmed the portfolio's index.html already links to `assets/projects/ogoni-ecowatch/ogoni-ecowatch-project.pdf`. The link will work once the PDF is uploaded to this folder.
- Left the portfolio links and thumbnails intact so the site will display the project immediately after the PDF or images are added.

## Suggested next steps
1. Upload `ogoni-ecowatch-project.pdf` to this directory. Once in place, the portfolio will serve the PDF at:
   `https://gbohigbaradc.github.io/assets/projects/ogoni-ecowatch/ogoni-ecowatch-project.pdf`
2. Add `ogoni-ecowatch-thumb.jpg` if a thumbnail is not yet available.
3. If you want to include reproducible code, add a `code/` folder with a README, requirements file (requirements.txt), and example notebook or script.
4. Add a license (e.g., `LICENSE` in repo root) to clarify reuse terms.
